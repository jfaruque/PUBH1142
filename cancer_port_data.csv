Footnotes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Caution should be used when interpreting these Mortality Incidence Rate Ratios as coding for death certificates and cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incidence records may vary significantly. The cancer incidence records are likely to be coded to a more specific topographic,,,,,,,,,,,,,
site which may give a false impression of an elevated rate ratio. Ratio values greater than 1 are flagged as Unreliable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caveats:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1. Statistics are suppressed to protect personal privacy, for the following conditions: <ol><li> Data are suppressed if the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
figures represent fewer than 16 cases for the specific category in the table cell. </li><li> Counts and rates are suppressed for,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cells at the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) level for the race categories ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" or ""Asian",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"or Pacific Islander"" when the specific category's population for rate calculations is less than 50,000 persons. </li><li> Data",,,,,,,,,,,,,
are suppressed at the state and MSA level for certain race and ethnicity groups: <ul><li> American Indian or Alaska Native data,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are suppressed at the state and MSA level for residents of Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, and New York; </li><li> Hispanic Asian",,,,,,,,,,,,,
or Pacific Islander and Hispanic Black or African American data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for residents of,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kansas; </li><li> Race by ethnicity data are suppressed for state specific statistics for residents of North Dakota and,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wisconsin. Ethnicity data are also suppressed for residents of North Dakota and Wisconsin. </li></ul> </li></ol> States decide,,,,,,,,,,,,,
whether to suppress data for specific race and ethnicity categories. The suppression criteria may vary in previous releases of,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these data More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/CancerMIR-v2020.html#Confidentiality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites because aggregate values are displayed in the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be misleading.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3. About rate comparisons: <ul><li> For consistency with the data on cancer incidence, the cancer sites in mortality data were",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"grouped according to the revised SEER recodes dated March 1, 2018 (see SEER Cause of Death Recodes:",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"http://seer.cancer.gov/codrecode/.). Because NCHS uses different groupings for some sites, the death rates in this report may",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"differ slightly from those published by NCHS. In addition, under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), there are",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"differences in mortality and incidence coding. For example, there are several codes for mesothelioma in ICD-10 (depending on the",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"primary site). However in ICD-O-3, one code captures all of the primary sites that mesothelioma affects. Note that Kaposi",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sarcoma deaths included in this dataset are only those deaths with underlying cause of death attributed to Kaposi Sarcoma, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"do not include deaths where the condition was a contributing cause of death, or subsequent to another underlying condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"</li><li> The population used to age-adjust the rates in this report is the 2000 U.S. standard population, which is in",,,,,,,,,,,,,
accordance with a 1998 recommendation of the US. Department of Health and Human Services. The 2000 U.S. standard population is,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"based on the proportion of the 2000 population in specific age groups (younger than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"15-19 years, . . . 85 years or older); the proportions of the 2000 population in these age groups serve as weights for",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"calculating age-adjusted incidence and death rates. NCHS, however, uses a different set of age groups in its age adjustment of",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"death rates, and thus the cancer death rates in this report may differ slightly from those published by NCHS. </li><li> Deaths",,,,,,,,,,,,,
of persons of unknown age are not included in this data set. Death rates may differ slightly from other reports where deaths of,,,,,,,,,,,,,
persons of unknown age are included. </li></ul>,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4. Cancer incidence counts, populations, and rates may differ from those found in the United States Cancer Statistics incidence",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reports and data, because these data include only those specific cancer sites that can be linked to the mortality data. For",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"example, in situ breast cancers are not included, and the appendix is not specified as a cancer site here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"5. Cancer mortality counts, populations, and rates may differ from those found in the United States Cancer Statistics mortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reports and data, because these data include only those specific reporting populations that can be linked to the incidence data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, cancer incidence data are not available for all places and years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"6. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
7. Incidence data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria. Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"shown for the United States are diagnoses, deaths and populations only from places and years for included cancer registries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
